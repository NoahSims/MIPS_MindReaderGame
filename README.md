To run the game:
1)	Open the MindReaderGame.asm file in MARS, then assemble and run the program to begin the game.
2)	The game will ask the user to choose a number from 1 – 64. Keep this number in mind. The game will ask the user for input to proceed. ‘Y’ or ‘y’ will continue the game, ‘N’ or     ‘n’ will exit, any other input is invalid and will ask the user to enter a valid input.
3)	As the game proceeds, the user will be presented with a card of 32 numbers and the game will ask if the user’s number is on the card. Respond ‘y’ if the number was on the card     or ‘n’ if the number was not on the card.
4)	Repeat step 3 until the game works out the user’s number
5)	The game will then give the user the option to play again. Enter ‘y’ to begin the game again or ‘n’ to exit the program
